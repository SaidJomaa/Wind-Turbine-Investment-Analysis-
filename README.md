# Wind Turbine Investment Analysis 

## Overview 
The task involved assessing the U.S. wind turbine market for a clean energy private equity firm. The team was given primary datasets and was expected to analyze them along with external sources to deliver findings to the investment committee. The project was conducted over a 3-day data sprint, with collaboration among team members.

## Methodology
The team cleaned the data using Python and pandas. They split larger tables into smaller data frames, maintained UUIDs for data linkage, removed unnecessary null values, and filled statistical nulls with zeros. They applied various cleaning techniques specific to each dataset, such as fixing invalid FIPS codes and assigning new values based on existing information. The cleaned datasets were then visualized using seaborn and matplotlib, and the data was loaded into Tableau for further analysis.

## Results
The analysis revealed insights about the global wind power market and the U.S. wind turbine market. The growth of wind generation in the U.S. and China was highlighted, and the concentration of wind turbine plants in the Midwest, with Texas leading, was identified. Some operators were found to be more efficient than others, and factors such as turbine size and location (onshore vs. offshore) were associated with power generation and revenue. Rough financial estimates and insights on government incentives and costs were also provided.

## Limitations
The project had limitations due to time constraints and the availability of data. As a result, the analysis provided a high-level overview rather than in-depth insights. Some datasets were unrelated, preventing comprehensive analysis across different factors. Further analysis, such as examining ROI, power loss through transmission lines, government incentives and regulations, and competition among operators, was suggested as potential next steps to address these limitations and provide more substantial findings.
